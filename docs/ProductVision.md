### Vision Statement


Do you have that one friend who always withdraws at the last minute and lets you hanging Don't worry, 
with **SportStack** we help you not cancelling your activity. Create an event and send it to whatever 
group you think is going to help you get that last player and you can still make it happen.
If you just don't want go run by yourself, or go to the gym or cycling, no matter the sport you want to 
practice we help you find rivals and teammates.

and let your friends join you.

Presence confirmation - There is a button for each event that allows the user to participate in that event and decreases the capacity of the event

Places - given the sports selected as favorite there is a screen with suggested places to practice and evaluations by other users

Group messages - For each group there should be a chat available so people can talk about some event coming
or just talking about a past event or make proper arrangements to an event taking place in a near future.
