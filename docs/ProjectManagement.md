## Project management



#### **Iteration 0**

[Release](https://github.com/FEUP-LEIC-ES-2022-23/2LEIC03T5/releases/tag/v0.1)

On this iteration, we focused on a more general aspect, which was the login window (the first window when we open the app) and its dependencies, as create of a new user and password recovery.
Furthermore we also proposed to create the main page of the app, even if it was just to have a visual image of we wanted.

#### *Retrospective*

Looking backwards on the first moment of the app, we were able to link our app to the database, its creation of the user, respective verification of the credentials in the login as well as the creation of a new member.

Most important of all, we began to work with flutter, which will helps us in the future of our project, leading to quicker implementation.

* Release management: [v0.1](https://github.com/FEUP-LEIC-ES-2022-23/2LEIC03T5/releases/tag/v0.1);


#### **Iteration 1**

For this iteration we tried to be a bit more ambicious and start to work on the specifities of our app, such as the creation of an event. Besides that in this iteration we will continue to work on the connection between our code and the database with the creation of a group of users. We had a meeting to review what had been done and to discuss what we should in this next moment. We decided in this meeting to split the work into groups.

#### *Retrospective*

This iteration has clearly to be evaluated negatively, due to lack of development on the app. During this time no features were added.


#### **Iteration 2**

Given the poor development done in the last delivery of our assignment, for this iteration we decided not to add any more 
features, and try to do what we previously have committed to do. So, for this iteration we had no more features beyond our last iteration ones.


#### *Retrospective*

Contrary to what happened on the last iteration, this week made a positive development. We implemented the groups page, which will contain 
the events and other possible posts, and we can see the users of the group and add elements. Besides that, we implemented the 
messages feature inside the groups, so users can chat inside between them inside a group (this feature was not planned, we made it as a plus for this iteration).
Finally we added a parameter to our profile screen so the user could make changes to their personal information.

So, by the end of this stage, this is how our project looks like:
