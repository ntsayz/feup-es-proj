#### **Iteration 0**

[Release](https://github.com/FEUP-LEIC-ES-2022-23/2LEIC03T5/releases/tag/v0.1)

On this iteration, we focused on a more general aspect, which was the login window (the first window when we open the app) and its dependencies, as create of a new user and password recovery.
Furthermore we also proposed to create the main page of the app, even if it was just to have a visual image of we wanted.

#### *Retrospective*

Looking backwards on the first moment of the app, we were able to link our app to the database, its creation of the user, respective verification of the credentials in the login as well as the creation of a new member.

Most important of all, we began to work with flutter, which will helps us in the future of our project, leading to quicker implementation.

* Release management: [v0.1](https://github.com/FEUP-LEIC-ES-2022-23/2LEIC03T5/releases/tag/v0.1);


#### **Iteration 1**

For this iteration we tried to be a bit more ambicious and start to work on the specifities of our app, such as the creation of an event. Besides that in this iteration we will continue to work on the connection between our code and the database with the creation of a group of users. We had a meeting to review what had been done and to discuss what we should in this next moment. We decided in this meeting to split the work into groups.

#### *Retrospective*

This iteration has clearly to be evaluated negatively, due to lack of development on the app. During this time no features were added.


#### **Iteration 2**

Given the poor development done in the last delivery of our assignment, for this iteration we decided not to add any more 
features, and try to do what we previously have committed to do. So, for this iteration we had no more features beyond our last iteration ones.


#### *Retrospective*

Contrary to what happened on the last iteration, this week made a positive development. We implemented the groups page, which will contain 
the events and other possible posts, and we can see the users of the group and add elements. Besides that, we implemented the 
messages feature inside the groups, so users can chat inside between them inside a group (this feature was not planned, we made it as a plus for this iteration).
Finally we added a parameter to our profile screen so the user could make changes to their personal information.

So, by the end of this stage, this is how our project looks like:

* Release management: [v0.2](https://github.com/FEUP-LEIC-ES-2022-23/2LEIC03T5/releases/tag/v0.2)


#### **Iteration 3**

Taking advantage of the good line of work we had from the previous iteration, for this couple weeks we decided
to continue with the good work and the improvement of our app. So, for this iteration we committed to start implementing
the map in our application, so that we had a screen just to see a map, and in the future see the pins with events. 
Additionally we also want to create a screen where I can see various locations and their evaluations from other users.

#### *Retrospective*

By the end of this iteration we can say that it was once again a positive development. We successfully implemented the 
maps in our application, also, the users will be able to see what events are happening near them as well as filter
by sport. Additionally we had our last screen missing, which was the places, where we can see places around us, 
their comments and evaluations by other users.

* Release management: [v0.3](https://github.com/FEUP-LEIC-ES-2022-23/2LEIC03T5/releases/tag/v0.3)


#### **Iteration 4**

For this final iteration and taking in account we had several things unfinished in our work, we tried to
divide between our members who were working, to try to get the maximum of our work. So, we focused on the tests 
and finishing what we could of our app and finish also all the documentation.

#### *Retrospective*

In this iteration we were very focused on documentation left and test that we didn't do, and not in incrementing 
value to our app, just correcting some bugs of the existing features. We were able to organize and update 
all of the documentation left and correct some issues we had in the already existing documentation.
As for the tests, we were able to do both unit and acceptance test.





#### *Final Thoughts and global Retrospective*
Now that the work is all done and delivered, the active members of our group can by far say that we were 
penalized by the lack of commitment by the other members. From the first iteration to the last only 3
of our members helped actively in the development of the work, and that made things far more difficult to our group.
Apart from that, between us, despite our not so good communication, we were able to split the work between us 
and try to get out the best we could. The app didn't took a linear progress and it's not a top-notch app,
but overall it does some things of what we proposed ourselves to do and has its own market value and is 
adds value to the end user. 
Globally, this was a nice journey and we were able to overcome the difficulties we were getting along the way.
Even though our app does not have a top notch design, it is user friendly and has a value to the end user.
