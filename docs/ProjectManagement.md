#### **Iteration 0**

[Release](https://github.com/FEUP-LEIC-ES-2022-23/2LEIC03T5/releases/tag/v0.1)

On this iteration, we focused on a more general aspect, which was the login window (the first window when we open the app) and its dependencies, as create of a new user and password recovery.
Furthermore we also proposed to create the main page of the app, even if it was just to have a visual image of we wanted.

#### *Retrospective*

Looking backwards on the first moment of the app, we were able to link our app to the database, its creation of the user, respective verification of the credentials in the login as well as the creation of a new member.

Most important of all, we began to work with flutter, which will helps us in the future of our project, leading to quicker implementation.

* Release management: [v0.1](https://github.com/FEUP-LEIC-ES-2022-23/2LEIC03T5/releases/tag/v0.1);


#### **Iteration 1**

![Iteration Backlog for Iteration 1](https://github.com/FEUP-LEIC-ES-2022-23/2LEIC03T5/blob/ddae9b1058a53c502701314e0453f0ef651e3103/images/Iteration%201%20backlog.png)

For this iteration we tried to be a bit more ambicious and start to work on the specifities of our app, such as the creation of an event. Besides that in this iteration we will continue to work on the connection between our code and the database with the creation of a group of users. We had a meeting to review what had been done and to discuss what we should in this next moment. We decided in this meeting to split the work into groups.

#### *Retrospective*

This iteration has clearly to be evaluated negatively, due to lack of development on the app. During this time no features were added.


#### **Iteration 2**

Given the poor development done in the last delivery of our assignment, for this iteration we decided not to add any more 
features, and try to do what we previously have committed to do. So, for this iteration we had no more features beyond our last iteration ones.


#### *Retrospective*

At the end of this week, we implemented the planned features, resulting a more positive frame for us. The groups were created, 
each user has the groups that he belongs to, and inside each group it is possible to add an element by an username.
